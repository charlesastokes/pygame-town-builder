# pygame-town-builder

pygame-town-builder is a proof-of-concept game engine that explores the capabilities of AI language models in developing complex coding projects. Built using Python and Pygame, the engine focuses on:

* Evaluating the reasoning abilities of the ChatGPT o1 Model.
* Testing the effects of context window degradation over extended sessions.
* Demonstrating AI-assisted programming in game development.

## Links to ChatGPT Sessions

Below are links to chat sessions used to build all the code for the game engine using ChatGPT o1. Code is not modified outside the chat session.

Image assets are generated using 4o and edited to remove backgrounds.
